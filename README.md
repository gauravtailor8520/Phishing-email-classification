## Project Overview

The main objective of this project is to build an accurate and efficient email spam detection model using machine learning and NLP techniques. By training on a dataset of emails labeled as spam or non-spam, the model can classify new emails, helping reduce spam in email inboxes.

NLP Email Spam and Phishing Detection Projects

This repository contains three NLP-based projects that analyze and detect spam and phishing emails. Using various machine learning and deep learning techniques, each project focuses on a different approach to solving the problem of email classification.
