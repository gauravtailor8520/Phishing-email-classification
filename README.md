# Email Spam Detection with NLP

This project focuses on detecting spam emails using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. It involves training machine learning models on a dataset of emails, identifying patterns associated with spam, and classifying new emails as either spam or non-spam.

## Project Overview

The main objective of this project is to build an accurate and efficient email spam detection model using machine learning and NLP techniques. By training on a dataset of emails labeled as spam or non-spam, the model can classify new emails, helping reduce spam in email inboxes.

NLP Email Spam and Phishing Detection Projects

This repository contains three NLP-based projects that analyze and detect spam and phishing emails. Using various machine learning and deep learning techniques, each project focuses on a different approach to solving the problem of email classification.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains labeled emails with a binary classification: spam or non-spam. Key features extracted from the emails include word frequencies, text length, and other linguistic features that can help distinguish spam from legitimate emails.


## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- scikit-learn
- nltk
- pandas
- numpy

You can install the required packages using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
